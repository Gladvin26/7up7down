# ðŸŽ² 7 Up 7 Down Game ðŸŽ²

Welcome to the 7 Up 7 Down dice betting game! This fun and interactive game challenges players to predict the sum of two dice and win or lose based on their guess.

## Game Description
In 7 Up 7 Down, players bet on whether the sum of two rolled dice will be:
- Higher than 7 (7 Up)
- Lower than 7 (7 Down)
- Exactly 7 (Lucky 7)

Each choice has its own rewards and risks:
- 7 Up or 7 Down: Predict if the dice sum will be above or below 7. A correct guess wins the bet amount, while an incorrect guess loses it.
- Lucky 7: Predict that the dice sum will equal 7 exactly! If guessed correctly, you win double your bet, but if you miss, you lose double.

## How to Play
1. Start with an initial balance by withdrawing money from your "ATM" (in-game funds).
2. Place your bet: Choose an amount and select one of the three options.
3. Roll the dice: The dice sum determines whether you win or lose.
4. Keep playing: If you run out of money, you can withdraw more from the "ATM" and continue playing.
5. End the game: Withdraw your balance at any time and exit with your winnings.

## Features
