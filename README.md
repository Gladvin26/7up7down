# 7up7down
7 Up 7 Down is an exciting dice betting game that challenges players to predict the sum of two rolled dice, with options to bet that the sum will be above 7 (7 Up), below 7 (7 Down), or exactly 7 (Lucky 7). Each prediction carries a unique risk and reward: guessing 7 Up or 7 Down correctly wins the bet amount, while a wrong guess loses it.
